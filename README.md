Garmin watch face

Props given to Joshua Miller for his tutorial which I thought was the most straightforward.
There are many so called 'starter' tutorials but I truly believe he explained things quickly
and appropriately.

I also did my own reading to better understand how to make my own watch face
The Garmin Developer Core Topics is a great place to munch on some info and try to emulate it

This watch is a work in progress and my very first one so please don't hate too much on this noob.

Sincerely,
Matt Crowe
